# MyInputComponent

`MyInputComponent` is a basic form component that captures user input and maintains its value using React's state management.

## Usage

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { MyInputComponent } from "your-ui-library";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Input Component Example</h1>
      <MyInputComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Props

MyInputComponent does not accept any props currently. It manages the state internally.

## Features

- State Management: The component uses useState to store and update the input value.
- Event Handling: The input field listens for onChange events and updates its value accordingly.
- Styling: The input field comes with basic styles like shadow, border, and focus state using Tailwind CSS classes.

## Example

Below is an interactive example of the MyInputComponent:

<MyInputComponent />
